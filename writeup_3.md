# Milestone 3 Write Up

### Reflection on the usefulness of the feedback you received.

*Comment on usability*

In general, reviewers found our app are easily implemented. At the first time they see our app, they are able to use the filter bar to select different locations and see different interactive plots. They aggreged that our app has an intuitive interface and good plots with publication quality. Some users are confused on the country input because they don't know they are able have multiple choices. Also, some users know less about the interactive plots, so they don't point to the plots to extra information. 


*Comment on feedbacks*

Across different reviews by peers and TA, we have heard some similar suggestions. Their comments are related to the usability of the drop-down menu and the quality of the plots. They have gave us suggestions to change reorder our "quality" legend in input clickbox as well as the legend shown in plots. Moreover, most reviews think filtering one country at one time will be more user friendly.

There are a few appropriate improvements we are able do by given the time frame that we have. First, to make the all plots are easy to be seen in different computer versions, we add two usage tabs to separate our two distribution plots and scatter plots. Second, to give out users more filter options, we add a new price filter option below the drop-down menu. Third, we have limited the input of country to one country and add a `PickerInput` options to other drop-down menu to allow users to "Select All" and "Deselect All" the choices they have. Forth, we reordered our "quality" legend to the order of low, medium and high.

However, there are some suggestions we would likely to take, but it's unreasonable to make changes at this time. We have received suggestions to use a choropleth world map for country selection, but this is too time consuming because our original dataset doesn't include latitudes and longitudes. We are also unable to fix the overwriting of the menu on the chart titles because that's part of the interactive plots. 

All the feedbacks are valuable to us because we have more ideas on how to improve our app. The most valuable part of the feedback process is "Fly-on-the-wall" because it's the most intuitive way to receive feedbacks from first-time users of our app. Our team is so appreciated all the feedbacks that we received. 

### Reflection on how your project has changed since Milestone 2, and why.
Our objective for this app doesn't change since millstone 2 that we would like to give users a way to explore how price and rating of varieties of wines varies over different locations. Rather than different quality categories, the inclusion of price range categories allowed further flexibility to filter choice. One of the biggest changes that we make for millstone 3 is the layout of our app because we added two usage tabs to separate three plots, while previously, we have all three plots in the same page.
