# Milestone 3 Write Up

### Reflection on the usefulness of the feedback you received.

*Comments on usability*

In general, reviewers found our app easily to use and intuitive. The first time they saw our app, they are able to use the filter bar to select different locations and see different interactive plots. They agreed that our app has an intuitive interface and good plots at publication quality. Some users are confused on the country input because they don't know they were able to have multiple choices. Also, some users knew less about the interactive plots, so they weren't able to access the additional information gained from hovering on the cross plot.


*Comments on feedback*

Across different reviews by peers and the TA, we heard some similar suggestions. Their comments were related to the usability of the drop-down menu and the quality of the plots. They have gave us suggestions to reorder our "quality" input checkboxes as well as the legend shown in plots. Moreover, most reviews think filtering one country at one time will be more user friendly.

There are a few appropriate improvements we are able do by given the time frame that we have. First, to make sure all plots are consistently seen in different computer versions, we added two usage tabs to separate our two distribution plots and scatter plot. Second, to give our users more filter options, we add a new price filter option below the drop-down menu, wine price. Third, we have limited the input of country to one country and added a `PickerInput` options to other drop-down menu to allow users to "Select All" and "Deselect All" from the choices they have. Fourth, we reordered our "quality" legend to the order of low, medium and high.

However, there are some suggestions we would likely to take, but it's unreasonable to make changes at this time. We have received suggestions to use a choropleth world map for country selection, but this would be too time consuming because our original dataset doesn't include latitudes and longitudes. We are also unable to fix the overwriting of the menu on the chart titles because that's part of the interactive plots, so went with the added functionality of hover plots rather than that minor inconvenience.

All the feedbacks are valuable to us because we have more ideas on how to improve our app. The most valuable part of the feedback process was "Fly-on-the-wall" because it was the most accurate way to view usage from first-time users of our app. Our team is very appreciative of all the feedback that we received.

### Reflection on how your project has changed since Milestone 2, and why.
Our objective for this app hasn't changed since milestone 2; that we would like to give users a way to explore how price and rating of varieties of wines varies over different locations. In addition to different quality categories, the inclusion of price range categories allowed further flexibility to filter choice. One of the biggest changes that we made for millstone 3 was the layout of our app because we added two usage tabs to separate three plots, while previously we had all three plots crowded in the same page.
