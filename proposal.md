## Overview
When choosing a bottle of wine the region and variety can impact quality and price; and liqour stores typically have wines sorted by country or region.  Understanding the distribution of these variables could help an average person or sommelier choose a country or region that fits their needs, and subsequently a better wine.  We propose building a shiny app that filters wines by country and/or variety, which then shows related price and score distributions.  In addition, counts of different varieties and provinces for the selection will provide context for the filtered selections.
